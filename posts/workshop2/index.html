A competition for students between grades 7-12. We registered 12 students of age group 7 to 13 years charging them Rs 500 per head. In the workshop we thought them how to build a basic robot using Lego Mindstorms Ev3. We also thought them the basics of coding using a software called Ev3 classroom. We first introduced ourselves and informed them about the FTC competition as a part of an outreach activity. We explained them the benefits of learning robotics. We taught them how to give commands to the robots and make them perform specific tasks. The students as well as the teachers were keen in learning and exploring new things. There were also activities and challenges for the students to solve. We collected Rs 6,000/- in total.
